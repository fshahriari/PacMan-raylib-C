# PacMan Using Raylib Library

It's my final project for my C course in the university.
Developed a lightweight and responsive Pac-Man game using C and the Raylib graphics library (under 1000 LOC). The game features smooth animations, engaging visual effects, and dynamic sound interactions. Focused on efficient memory use and clean code architecture while applying fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditions, file handling, and basic game logic.
